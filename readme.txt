This program allows the users to view and manage appointments, as well as their related components.
It is designed to handle international business, providing localization and time conversion.

To operate, simply unzip the application package into the projects folder of your favorite IDE.
Run the main configuration, then enter user login details. If login is verified, you will then be directed to
the Main Screen, where you can view all appointments with your UserID attached to them. You can also navigate to
the Manage Customers, Manage Appointments, and View Reports screen.

Manage Customers allows you to add, update, and delete customer records.

Manage Appointments allows you to add, update, and delete appointment records.

View Reports allows you to view three unique reports, providing insight to your database.
In addition the two pre-defined reports, I implemented the "Customers by Country" report that will
give valuable business insight on where customers are located.
